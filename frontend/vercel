## Vercel environment reference for frontend
# This file lists the environment variables the frontend app needs when deployed to Vercel.
# Do NOT commit secrets. Add them in the Vercel dashboard: Project > Settings > Environment Variables.

# Backend URL (after backend is deployed, paste the full URL here in Vercel settings)
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-url.vercel.app

# Notes:
# - Build Command (Vercel): npm run build
# - Output Directory (Vercel): dist
# - The frontend app reads `import.meta.env.VITE_BACKEND_URL` at build time.
